# Notes on Syntax

Simple syntax notes for myself to remember. I enjoy c#,java and rust at the moment, but i am very intested in compiled languages for some reason, I am looking to do some C++/C and some zig, but thats for laaater.


# C# 

All the syntax usage with examples, of course ill be using chatgpt, but ill modify some stuff for my needs.

# Java

Mainly for backend, so ill be having some exampels for Spring as well.

# Rust 

Basic sytnax really, nothing special, and of course borrowship stuff.
